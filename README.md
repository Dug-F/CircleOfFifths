# CircleOfFifths
The circle of fifths is a visual representation of the relationship between the 12 tones of the chromatic scale, their corresponding key signatures, and the associated major and minor keys. 

It is a very valuable tool in music theory and composition.  However, most representations of the Circle of Fifths are static and give only limited assistance in appreciating the relationships between the notes.

This app aims to be much more dynamic and interactive to help both learn the Circle of Fifths and then explore the rich relationships it reveals.  It helps understand aspects of harmonic theory more deeply, which will ultimately help in composition and improvisation.
